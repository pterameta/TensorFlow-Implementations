Put space.mp3 in the same folder as Encodec.ipynb
Run Encodec.ipynb

The notebook shows how Encodec can quantize the audio using an encoder and performing Residual Vector Quantization on the embedding space.
It also shows how to decode the quantized code to get back the original audio.

This quantized code is used by VALL-E to generate audio that mimics the original speaker's characteristics and background acoustics.
